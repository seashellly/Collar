6.7 is out, and has many exciting new options! First, Vanilla has been overhauled and powered up, becoming a full fledged mode of its own. Next, the RLV relay is slimmer and meaner than ever. RLV outfits were also made more robust. Finally in addition to all the normal tweaks and fixes, a security exploit has been eliminated. This update is highly recommended to keep you safe and trouble free!
