License Terms for the OpenCollar™ Role Play Device | 2016-01-20

raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenCollar/opencollar/master/LICENSE

--------------------------------------------------------------

Preamble and Introduction

    The OpenCollar Role Play Device is made of many parts.
    There are motions, images, models and sounds, with the
    largest part being of course the software.

    In a situation where one item is made of many things,
    which were made by many different people, we end up with
    a flurry of various authorships, permissions and ideas
    what should and what should not be allowed if you want to
    pass the device as a whole or in parts on to your
    friends.

    In a nutshell, everyone must follow these basic rules:

    1. All scripts are licensed as and must remain under the
       GNU General Public License, version 2.

    2. Most contents are licensed as and must remain under
       the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
       International Public License.

    3. Everything else where no explicit license was applied
       is covered by this License Addendum.

    4. Everything coming from us which was FULL PERMS also
       has to remain FULL PERMS if you wish to share it with
       your friends.

--------------------------------------------------------------

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept
and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the
License Terms for the OpenCollar Role Play Device. To the
extent these license terms may be interpreted as a contract,
You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor
grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the
Licensor receives from making the Licensed Scripts and
Contents available under these terms and conditions.


§ 1.) Definitions:

    a. "FULL PERMS" means maintaining MODIFY, COPY, and
        TRANSFER permissions in Second Life(R), OpenSimulator
        and the metaverse. If these platforms should allow
        more fine-grained permissions in the future, then
        "FULL PERMS" will mean the most permissive possible
        set of permissions allowed by the platform.

    b. "License Addendum" means the verbatim text of License
        Terms for the OpenCollar Role Play Device.

    c. "Default OpenCollar" means the unaltered OpenCollar
        Role Play Device, with unaltered scripts and contents,
        and without any additions, as it is distributed by the
        Licensor.

    d. "Spares" means the collection of OpenCollar
       scripts, plugins, programs and snippets shared by users
       within the metaverse and/or published at Our
       collaborative repository on GitHub
       (https://github.com/OpenCollar/opencollar/tree/master/src/spares).

    e. "Link-set" means the arrangement of prim 3D models
        which result in the final device e.g. the Default
        OpenCollar or the OpenCollar Updater.

    f. "Authors" means the individual authors of and/or
       contributors to the specified script or content as each
       described.

    g. "Licensed Scripts and Contents" means the artistic
       and/or technical creation to which the Licensor applied
       this License Addendum.

    h. "Licensed Rights" means the rights granted to You
       subject to the terms and conditions of this License
       Addendum, which are limited to all Copyright and
       Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
       Scripts and Contents and that the Licensor has
       authority to license.

    i. "Licensor" means the current maintainer and
       distributor of the original source code
       (https://github.com/OpenCollar) who is granting rights
       under this License Addendum. "We" and "Our" have
       corresponding meanings.

    j. "You" means the individual or entity exercising the
       Licensed Rights under these terms. "Your" has a
       corresponding meaning.


§ 2.) Scripts:

    a. The OpenCollar scripts are licensed under the
       GNU General Public License, version 2
       (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0) and are free to
       be studied, copied, modified, and redistributed, in
       respect to the following guidelines:

            i. If You distribute the OpenCollar scripts, You
               must leave them FULL PERMS.

           ii. If You include the scripts in items that You
               make, You must leave the scripts FULL PERMS.

          iii. If You modify the OpenCollar scripts and
               distribute the modifications, You must also
               make Your modifications FULL PERMS and point
               to a log of changes e.g. readme file, git log,
               svn history.

           iv. In all cases a verbatim copy of this License
               Addendum must be included and all OpenCollar
               scripts must remain under the GNU General
               Public License, version 2.

    b. While We hope to encourage others to write indeed Free
       Software, custom plugins are not subject to the above
       conditions if the following requirements are met:

            i. The program is entirely written by You,
               without basing on existing OpenCollar scripts
               and without the use of snippets from existing
               OpenCollar scripts, including Spares.

           ii. The program compiles individually. (This is
               the case for all scripts on Second Life(R).)

          iii. The program communicates with the OpenCollar
               scripts only through script link messages.


§ 3.) Models:

    a. The Default OpenCollar Link-set and its individual
       elements (in which various OpenCollar scripts and
       contents are placed) are a collaborative effort by
       Kyrah Abattoir as original creator for the 3D model
       and Wendy Starfall for the assembly and concept
       design. Both parts, original 3D model and Link-set are
       licensed under a Creative Commons
       Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
       (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)
       and must remain FULL PERMS.

    b. The Default OpenCollar Updater and Leash Holder
       Link-sets (in which various OpenCollar scripts and
       contents are placed), were created by Wendy Starfall.
       Both individual Link-sets are licensed under a Creative
       Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
       Public License
       (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)
       and must remain FULL PERMS.

    c. The default Leash Post is a derivative work by Wendy
       Starfall based on an assembly design concept by Lulu
       Pink. It is licensed under a Creative Commons
       Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
       (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)
       and must remain FULL PERMS.

    d. The default Graphical User Interfaces for the OpenCollar AO
       and the OpenCollar Remote are derivative works by Wendy
       Starfall based on an assembly design concept by Alexei Maven
       and Jessenia Mocha. They are licensed under a Creative
       Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
       (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode).

    e. RESTRICTING THE MODIFY PERMISSION ON OPENCOLLAR
       SCRIPTED ITEMS THAT YOU INTEND TO DISTRIBUTE, WILL
       BREAK CORE FUNCTIONALITY LIKE PLUGIN MANAGEMENT,
       CUSTOMIZATION FEATURES, AND EXPANDABILITY AS WELL AS
       DENY USERS THE ABILITY TO UPDATE, STUDY AND MODIFY THE
       DEVICE, THEREFORE THE "NO MODIFY" PERMISSION CANNOT BE
       ENDORSED BY THE LICENSOR BY NO MEANS AT ALL.

            i. If You want to use the OpenCollar scripts in
               items that You have made and wish to
               distribute, You can restrict COPY or TRANSFER
               permissions on Your items, but must leave the
               OpenCollar scripts FULL PERMS.

           ii. If You want to recycle OpenCollar default
               Link-sets, as in linking artwork to existing
               OpenCollar default assemblies, You must
               attribute all previous creators, include the
               same license as stated in § 3a/b/c and the
               whole resulting Link-set must remain FULL PERMS.

          iii. In all cases a verbatim copy of this License
               Addendum must be included, all contents must
               remain under the same license terms as stated
               in § 3a/b/c/d and all OpenCollar scripts must
               remain under the GNU General Public License,
               version 2.

       THIS DEVICE.

    b. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of
       liability provided above shall be interpreted in a
       manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
       approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
       liability.


§ 7.) Term and Termination:

    a. The License Terms for the OpenCollar Role Play Device
       apply for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
       licensed here and as described in individual licenses
       per scripts or contents, such as the GNU General Public
       License, version 2 or the Creative Commons
       Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public
       License. However, if You fail to comply with this
       License Addendum, then Your rights under this License
       Addendum terminate automatically.

    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Scripts and
       Contents has terminated under § 7/a, it reinstates:

            i. automatically as of the date the violation is
               cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of
               Your discovery of the violation; or

           ii. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

    For the avoidance of doubt, §7/b does not affect any
    right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your
    violations of the License Terms for the OpenCollar Role
    Play Device.

    c. § 1, § 6, § 7, § 8 and § 9 survive termination of the
       License Terms for the OpenCollar Role Play Device.


§ 8.) Other Terms and Conditions:

    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or
       different terms or conditions communicated by You
       unless expressly agreed.

    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements
       regarding the Licensed Scripts and Contents not stated
       herein are separate from and independent of the terms
       and conditions of the License Terms for the OpenCollar
       Role Play Device.


§ 9.) Interpretation:

    a. For the avoidance of doubt, the License Terms for the
       OpenCollar Role Play Device do not, and shall not be
       interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
       conditions on any use of the Licensed Scripts and
       Contents that could lawfully be made without permission
       under this License Addendum.

    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of the License
       Terms for the OpenCollar Role Play Device is deemed
       unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to
       the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.
       If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be
       severed from this License Addendum without affecting
       the enforceability of the remaining terms and
       conditions.

    c. No term or condition of the License Terms for the
       OpenCollar Role Play Device will be waived and no
       failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed
       to by the Licensor.

    d. Nothing in the License Terms for the OpenCollar Role
       Play Device constitutes or may be interpreted as a
       limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and
       immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including
       from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
       authority.
